## Final Year Project - AgriDoc (Agricultural Robot)

This project was carried out over a span of 1 year thus it was divided into two parts i.e. 2 semesters

**Part1:**
- Mapped and Navigated Robot autonomously in Virtual Platform using LIDAR
- Real Time Object Detection using Resnet-18 and Google Net
- Designed the Battery Management System that partly runs on solar energy
- ROS and AI part was carried out using Jetson NANO

**Part2:**
- Built a Custom CNN architecture for Disease Detection across 9 commonly found tomato plant diseases
- YOLOv5 was used for Weed Detection across 3 commonly found weeds amongst tomato plants
- Robot's autonomous capabilities were achieved using HectorSLAM and ROS Navigation Tech Stack
- Weedicide Spraying system was developed that works in coordination with Weed Detection Algorithm and ROS Autonomous Navigation System
